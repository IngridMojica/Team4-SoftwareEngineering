## Files in this Branch Specifically:

    db_players.py: database helper functions using psycopg2 with parameterized queries.

    test_players.py: small script to verify insert and lookup.

    install.sh: optional helper to set up the venv and install psycopg2-binary.

## Usage

    Activate the environment

        . .venv/bin/activate

    Run the test

        python test_players.py

    Expected example output

        Insert first: True

        Insert duplicate: False

        Lookup existing: Ruben

        Lookup missing: None

## Verify in psql

    Describe the table

        psql -d photon -U student -h 127.0.0.1 -c "\d players"

    View rows

        psql -d photon -U student -h 127.0.0.1 -c "SELECT id, codename FROM players ORDER BY id;"

    Delete a test row (visit test_players.py for example id)

        psql -d photon -U student -h 127.0.0.1 -c "DELETE FROM players WHERE id = 501;"
